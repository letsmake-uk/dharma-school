title: Week 6 - Helpful resources
---

We hope you have enjoyed this short introduction to the possibilities of making with the <a href = "http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and [S4A](http://s4a.cat). Aside from all of the material we've put up on the website week-by-week, we have collected some more useful resources for you here so that you can continue playing and exploring with these tools on your own: 


## [Scratch 4 Arduino](http://s4a.cat)

This is where to get the S4A software for your own computer. There are also loads of handy guides and documentation for other great projects!

## <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino Software</a>

This is where you get the Arduino IDE or "Integrated Development Environment". You can use this software to program the Arduino using a text-based programming language called "C++" (pronounced "See Plus Plus"). It's a bit more tricky to get started with this programming language, but there are hundreds of great [guides](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) on the same website, which can take you from complete beginner to expert! If you're interested in this style of programming, look out for announcements on [Maker Lab](http://makerclub.org/makerlab) on courses we will be providing in the future.


## [TinkerCAD](http://www.tinkercad.com)
Tinker CAD is the web-based 3d software we worked with in week 5. You can create your own account for free, work on the tutorials, or get started making your own models, all over the web!


<!--## [Adafruit industries](http://adafruit.com)

This is a great place to look for new inputs and outputs that you can attach to your Arduino, like strings of colour [LEDs](http://adafruit.com/products/1643), and [infra-red distance sensors](http://adafruit.com/products/164). -->


## <a href = "http://fritzing.org/home/"> Fritzing </a>
Fritzing is an open source tool for making circuit diagrams. 

We used it for all of the diagrams in this workshop, and it is a really handy way of documenting your projects, and sharing the plans with others. 


## [Maker Club](http://makerclub.org)

Keep an eye out on the Maker Club website for more exciting courses being held during summer and after-school all year round!
