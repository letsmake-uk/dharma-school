## Some basic electronics: Ohm's law

Electricity is the flow of energy (in the form of electrons), through conductive materials like metal. 


The three most important properties of electric circuits are **Voltage (V)**, **Current (I)**, and **Resistance (R)**. 


It's sometimes quite useful to compare electronic circuits to water being pumped through a piping system, as in the diagram below (from the <a href= "http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/watcir2.html">hyperphysics website</a>, a super useful resource for all things science!):

In this comparison, **Voltage (V)** is like the pressure generated by the pump, it tells us how much *energy* the battery can give electrons to do their stuff with. 


**Current (I)** is like the flow of water through the pipes, it tells us *how many* electrons are passing through the circuit every second (the more electrons, the more powerful!). 


**Resistance (R)** is like a measure of how difficult it is for the water to get through the pipe system - If the pipes are small then the resistance is high (and so the current is low, because less water can get through every second). 


The mathematical relationship between these properties is:


**V = IR**


Which is called *Ohm's law*. What's helpful to know to understand this is that Voltage is normally fixed (it's written on the side of the battery), Resistance depends on the electronic components you're using (lamps, switches, motors), and then you can calculate the amount of current using Ohm's law!
