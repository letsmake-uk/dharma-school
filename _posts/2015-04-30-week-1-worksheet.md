This week, we are looking at how to control an Arduino using <a href="http://s4a.cat">Scratch 4 Arduino</a>

S4A has a custom Arduino Sprite, which has it's own special blocks

When you launch S4A if you don't have your Arduino connected you will see this message

![S4A Searching](../img/S4A searching board.jpg "S4A Searching")


When you connect the Arduino, the numbers on the analog pins should start jumping around

If you go to the blue "Motion" section at the top left, you should see all of S4A's special Arduino blocks

TODO : List all blocks? Maybe just look at pin 13, and poke about with analog out and digital in pins

TODO : Add all the examples of different ways to control the onboard LED
