title: Week 1 - Introduction
---

<!-- Welcome to <a href="http://makerclub.org">Maker Club</a>’s <b>Let’s Build Robots!</b>, a 6 week course being held at <a href="http://makerclub.org/makerlab">Maker Lab</a>, a community hub dedicated to digital education in Brighton. --> 


## Who are we?


<a href="http://digitaltinkerings.com">Louis d’Aboville</a> is a teacher, digital tinkerer and toy hacker. He helps to run creative workshops for young people as part of <a href="http://exploringsenses.co.uk">Exploring Senses</a>, and creates interactive projections for a range of events. His special powers include opening portals to other dimensions, and splicing together cast-off toys to create horrifying mutant creatures.

<a href="http://seymoursmith.net">Nic Seymour-Smith</a> is a teacher, programmer and electronic engineer. He tutors for the <a href="http://brighton.ac.uk">University of Brighton’s</a> Digital Media Arts course, runs digital skills workshops and builds interactive technology pieces for small companies and big businesses alike. His special powers include levitating water with sound-waves.

## So what exactly is a robot?


From Wikipedia:
"A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry."


That's super general right! This definition encompasses so much of the day-to-day technology we come into contact with, as well the stuff of movies - from artificial intelligences bent on world domination to 'spam bots' that send you junk mail, and from multi-million dollar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1czBcnX1Ww">BigDogs</a> to the timer on your toasting machine.


During this course we'll be focussing on controlling mechanical and electronic components using a small computer 'brain' called the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. We'll be looking at how electronic circuits and computers really work, as well as how our own custom parts can be manufactured using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing</a>.


## So what is an Arduino anyway?


An Arduino is a small programmable computer that we can use to make all kinds of clever interactive gadgets and gizmos. It is not a computer like the laptops we have on our desks, because rather than having only one set of inputs and outputs (the keyboard and mouse, and the monitor), it has literally dozens!.


Your Arduino uses any one of its 15 sockets (we usually call them 'pins', because of the shape of the wires we use to connect to them), to interface with a huge number of sensors and switches for input, or outputs like lights and motors - basically any other piece of technology that uses electricity. Here's a close up picture of an arduino with a few handy labels showing you what all the different bits do:

Although it's inputs and outputs are different from other computers, just like them we can program it. In fact with an Arduino, this is absolutely essential! Without instructions telling it how to deal with inputs, what calculations to make with data, and what to do with its outputs, it's really nothing more than a pretty blue piece of metal and plastic. 


## Programming the Arduino


Normally, if we wanted to program an Arduino (or any other computer for that matter) we would have to write some code to tell it what to do. This code has to be written in a very specific way so that the Arduino understands *exactly* what you want it to do.
 
This is what the code to blink an LED on and off looks like :

{% highlight c linenos %}
void setup() 
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);      // Set pin 13 up as an output. 
                            // Pin 13 has an LED built in.
}

void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
{% endhighlight %}


This is a bit of a confusing place to start if you have never done any programming, but luckily for us some clever folks in Spain have made a tool called S4A (or Scratch for Arduino) that let's us control the Arduino using custom blocks that they have added to Scratch. For an intro to S4A, go check out the <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-04-30-week-1-worksheet %}">Week 1 Worksheet</a>.


## Scratch 4 Arduino


We have already set up all of the laptops and Arduinos at the MakerLab to use S4A but if you want to download it on your computer you can grab it on the <a href="http://s4a.cat">S4A website</a>, where there is a bunch more information about the project.
