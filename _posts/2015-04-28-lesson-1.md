This week, we will be looking at what an Arduino is and how to control it using <a href="http://s4a.cat">Scratch 4 Arduino</a>


## So what is an Arduino?

An Arduino is a small programmable computer that we can use to make all kinds of clever interactive gadgets and gizmos. It is not like most computers you have used in the past because of it's inputs and outputs.

Your normal laptop computer uses things like a mouse and keyboard for input, and outputs images and sound. The Arduino uses things like switches or sensors for input, and can control things like lights, motors, and other physical outputs. 

Although it's inputs and outputs are different, just like any other computer we can program it. This means we can tell it what to do with it's inputs, how to store and use that information, and how to use that to control it's outputs.

This is an Arduino Uno :

## Programming the Arduino

Normally, if we wanted to program an Arduino (or any other computer for that matter) we would have to write some code to tell it what to do. 

This is what some code to control a servo motor looks like :

{% highlight c linenos %}
#include <Servo.h>
 
Servo myservo;         // create servo object to control a servo
int buttonOnePin = 2;
int button2pin = 3;
int val;               // servo position
int inc = 5;
 
void setup()
{
  myservo.attach(8);   // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
  val = 0; 
  myservo.write(val);
}
 
void loop()
{
  for(int i = 0; i < 180; i++)
  { 
    myservo.write(i);                 // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
    delay(5);                         // waits for the servo to get there

    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a bit of a confusing place to start if you have never done any programming, but luckily for us some clever folks in Spain have made a tool called S4A (or Scratch for Arduino) that let's us control the Arduino using custom blocks that they have added to Scratch.
